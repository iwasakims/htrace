HTrace
======
[HTrace](http://htrace.incubator.apache.org) is a tracing framework for use
with distributed systems.

For help on building the software, see [BUILDING.txt](./BUILDING.txt).

For details about integrating HTrace into an application, see the [developer
guide](./src/main/site/markdown/developer_guide.md)

If you have an idea or a patch to improve HTrace, file a [JIRA issue at the bug
tracker] (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/htrace) or post to our [mailing
list] (http://htrace.incubator.apache.org/mail-lists.html).

<b>NOTE</b>: Please create a JIRA issue for each pull request.  If you just create a
pull request but no JIRA, we might not notice your patch!

See the [release guide](./src/main/site/markdown/building.md) for
