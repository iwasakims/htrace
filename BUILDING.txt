On Building HTrace

Requires go version 1.3.1 or 1.4. Also requires godep. See hbase-core/src/go/BUILDING.txt for more.
Requires Java 1.7 at least.
Requires maven 3.x.

After installing go, to build, run:

 $ mvn install

To build a tarball, do:

 $ mvn clean install -DskipTests assembly:single -Pdist

This will build a tarball into ./target.

To skip the rat-check -- it can take a while -- pass
a -Drat.skip on the  mvn command-line.
