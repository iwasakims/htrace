Building the HTrace Go code
===========================
The htrace go code consists of 4 main parts:
* The "htraced" standalone server
    This is a server which accepts trace spans, and services REST queries.

* The "htrace" command-line program which can query the server
    This is a simple command-line program which can query the htrace server.

* The htraced Javascript Web UI (not yet implemented)

* The htrace go client library (not yet implemented)
    This is the equivalent of the Java HTrace client library, but written in Go.

You can build all these parts simply by running "gobuild.sh".
The binaries will be created in bin/.

Dependencies
============
You will need to install:
* The Go programming language
* The development package for leveldb (some Linux distros call this "leveldb-devel") containing libleveldb.so

htraced requires libleveldb.so to be in your shared library path in order to run.
You can set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path for this library, or simply install
libleveldb.so to your system library path.

Testing
=======
You can run the unit tests by running "src/go/gobuild.sh test"
